## Problem statement:
Implement a tail(1)-like tool, which prints last N lines for a file provided as a param and watch for the new entries and print them on stdout until interrupted (tail -f -n N equivalent).

## Approach
After asking a question, ask the candidate to explain how to solve it. If he/she has no idea about I/O please share some basics about it in the programming language of the candidate's choice. For python please tell candidates about open() function, and .read(), .readline(), .readlines(), .seek() methods. You can paste pydoc with the description of those methods. For other languages, if some API is not available we can propose read(),readlines(),readline(),seek() to implement it.
